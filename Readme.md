## Installation
Instructions for operating systems other than Windows should be the same with the exception of the Cura directory.
Copy the contents of "definitions", "extruders", and "quality" in this repository to the directories with the same name in %APPDATA%\Roaming\cura\3.6.

**NOTE** you may have to substitute the version of Cura you have installed, in this example it was 3.6. Obviously you would use a different directory for Windows and Linux see https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/wiki/Cura-Preferences-and-Settings-Locations
